# Bitcoinsama - The hub for your crypto needs

Bitcoinsama is a React/Node/MySQL/Express application that displays market information about the top 20 cryptocurrencies in circulation, financial charts for them, aggregated news for each individual currency and a conversion calculator. 

Some of the prominent technologies and packages used were:
* Sequelize for holding our article and market data
* APIs to Cryptocompare sourcing our data
* React-Helmet (node) for specifying SEO metadata
* react-snap (node) for doing a prerendering for SEO and google crawling
* chart.js (node) for visualizing our market data. 

Our app also maintains a RESTful interface, a MVC architecture, responsiveness and mobile friendliness.
